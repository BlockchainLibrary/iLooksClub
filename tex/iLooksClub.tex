\begin{itemize}
	\item What blockchains are and why they are important
	\item Although there is a lot of available information on technical aspects
	of blockchains there is no coherent space for on blockchain applications
	\item Although there is a lot of available information on technical aspects

\end{itemize}

% \lettrine[nindent=0em,lines=3]{A} decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an organization that is run through rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts and its financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain.
% The most famous DAO up to date has as purpose venture capital funding and is called The DAO, which was launched with US\$150 million in crowdfunding in May 2016 and was hacked and drained of approximately US\$50 million in cryptocurrency three weeks later \cite{Price2016}.\par 
% On May 26th of 2016, a paper\cite{Popper2016} first pointed out system vulnerabilities in the operation of The DAO, and recommended a temporary moratorium until all security breaches were fixed. Since its publication and the hack on June 17th, other system vulnerabilities were also found. The hacker had 22 days to study these points, collect all possibilities and take action.\par
% Security breaches are often found by specialists\cite{Perlroth2014}, then publicized as an alerting mechanism to avoid making harm to people. After that happens, hackers are motivated by the amount of money at stake to take action, and they often do way before the fix is deployed.\par
% The DAO was not engineered smart enough to deal with this specific problem. Actually it was not smart in the sense of smartness as we know it. Contrary to what the name suggests, it is also not autonomous yet, because whenever a smart decision needs to be taken, The DAO relies on a voting mechanism to reach its ultimate goal, where the more tokens the voter holds, the more voting power is given to it. In other words, The DAO utilizes human collective intelligence to decide therefore it should be called DO rather than DAO.

\section{The Blockchain Library organization}

\subsection{Blockchain Library vision}

\subsection{Library Shelf}
Aggregation of blockchain application documents

\subsection{Development Platform}
Space that allows the development of new whitepapers of blockchain applications.
 
\subsection{State of the art} 
The earliest library consisting of collections of clay tablets in cuneiformscript date back to 2600 BC \cite{History_of_Libraries2016}. Through the Libraryof Alexandria (3BC) up until the 1960s libraries existed as collections ofphysical information sources. Conceptually, one of the main contributions in thehistory of the preservation of human knowledge came from Vannevar Bush and hisfamous 1945 essay ``We May Think''. This paper predicted many technologies inwidespread use today including hypertext,PC, the Internet and Web and onlineencyclopedias \cite{As_We_May_Think2016}. Vannevar envisioned the Memex: acollective knowledge store where words and phrases are linked to associatedother terms. Doug Engelbart pursued this vision when in 1968 he gave the``Mother of All Demos'' \cite{Mother_of_All_Demos2016} demonstrating for thefirst time windows, hypertext, word processing, dynamic file linking andcollaborative work.For the most part digital libraries today and scholarly papers tend to replicate
the established structure of a library consisting of publications. Publications
may contain references to other publications. ScholOnto \cite{shum2000scholonto,
Scholonto2016} was one of the first projects to imagine and construct native Web
scholarly publishing. The main outcome of this project the notion of a scholarly
claim which linked an author to an assertion (a relationship between two
concepts or documents or between a concept or document and another claim)
supported by a justification.
